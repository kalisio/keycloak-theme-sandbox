_**Kalisio's [Keycloak themes](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/#_themes)**_

This project brings together a set of Keycloak themes used by [Kalisio](https://kalisio.com) applications.
Just like the applications developed by **Kalisio**, these themes are based on the use of the [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/)
This allows to have the same look & feel between the applications and the different user interfaces provided by [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/).

> [!Note]
>Before going any further, it is essential to understand how themes work in Keycloak and how one can create a theme. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/index.html#_themes) and [Apache FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/index.html).

## Understanding the KDK theme

The [KDK](./themes/kdk) theme extends the Keycloak's **base** theme with the following types of customization:
* **Login**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Other types, such as **Account** and **Admin**, can be easily extented from the **keycloak.v2** theme and we feel it is not worth providing such custom types in the KDK theme.
In the [kapp](./themes/kapp/) folder, we provide you with an example of customization of these different types.

### Login 

**Login** forms specialize a **FreeMaker** template file, `template.ftl`, that overwrites the default Keycloak `template.ftl` file. It is built on **Quasar Framework** to enable the use of web components that enhance user experience and simplify the use of Keycloak CSS classes.

The provided `template.ftl` introduces 4 areas, called **fragments** which can be overwritten by child themes. The following image illustrates the 4 fragments: **header**, **banner**, **options** and **footer**.

![Template fragments](./docs/keycloak-themes-fragments.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that all these fragments are shared by all the different login forms.

### Internationalization

Internationalization is in line with Keycloak's approach.

Consequently, the popup function will attempt to localize the specified file based on the current locale settings using the following schema: `<basename>_<locale>.<extension>`

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> If internationalization is disabled, the locale is set to `en`.

## Extending the KDK theme

### Minimum file stucture

The minimum file structure you need to create is the following:
```
my-theme
 ├ login
 |   |_ theme.json
 |   └─ resources
 |      ├─ js
 |      |   └─ config.js
 |      └─ img
 |          └─ logo.png
 └─ theme.properties
```
#### theme.json

The `theme.json` file allows you to provide extra informations that can be used by the various fragments.

By default the `theme.json` provides version informations for the theme as well as for the parent KDK theme:

```json
{
  "version": {
    "theme": "latest",
    "kdkTheme": "latest"
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> These informations are used by the default `footer.ftl` fragment which displays the different version in a tooltip.

#### theme.properties

The [theme.properties](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/index.html#theme-properties) file allows setting some configuration for the theme.

A **theme.properties** file commonly has content like this

```
parent=kdk 
import=common/keycloak
locales=fr,en
meta=viewport==width=device-width,initial-scale=1
```

#### config.js

The `config.js` file allows you to configure **Quasar** by defining a [Quasar Config Object](https://quasar.dev/start/umd/#quasar-config-object). 

> [!TIP]
> Use the Quasar Config Object to define the brand colors to be used in the application.

#### logo.png

This file represents the application logo. 

> [!TIP]
> The recommended size is about 400x150 pixels.

### Overwriting fragments

In addition, one can overwrite each fragments to adapt the page to its current need.You just need to add the desired `<fragment>.ftl` file in a `fragments` folder under the `login` folder.

For instance, if you need to overwrite the `options` fragment, add `options.ftl` file as shown below:
```
my-theme
 ├ login
 |   ├─ fragments
 |   |   └─ options.ftl
 |   └─ resources
 |      ├─ js
 |      |   └─ config.js
 |      └─ img
 |         └─ logo.png
 └─ theme.properties
```

### Helper functions

The **KDK** theme comes with an the `popup` function that enables you to display an **HTML** within a popup.

For example, the following lines allow to open the `legal-notice` html file when clicking on the button. In that special case, the complete file name will be resolved according the the locale of the browser:

```html
<q-btn flat label="${msg('legalNotice')}" flat no-caps rounded 
  @click="popup('${msg('legalNotice')}', '${url.resourcesPath}/html/legal-notice_${locale.currentLanguageTag}.html')" 
/>
```

## Checking the theme

To check the theme, we recomend to:

1. create a realm for your application
2. In `Realm Settings`, `Themes` tab, assign the app's theme to the `Login theme`
3. Log in to the app: `https://<keycloak.url>/realms/<app>/account/#/`

> [!NOTE]  
> In local, the url for the `kapp` example will be the following: http://localhost:8080/realms/kapp/account/#/

## Running Keycloak

We provide a generic [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file to let you run **Keycloak** locally to check your theme.

### Deploying the stack

As simple as that, just type the command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You can now log in to **Keycloak**:
1. Go to http://localhost:8080/
2. Click `Administration Console`
3. Login using the following credentials:
  
  - User: admin
  - Password: Pass;word1

### Removing the stack

To remove the stack, simply type the following command:

```bash
docker compose up down
```
